# UniswapV2 Clone

**Uniswap V2 Clone** is fully inspired by Uniswap V2.

In Uniswap V2, any ERC20 token can be pooled directly with any other ERC20 token.  
The introduction of ERC20 token/ERC20 token pools in Uniswap V2 can be useful for liquidity providers, who can maintain more diverse ERC20 token denominated positions, without mandatory exposure to ETH.  
Having direct ERC20/ERC20 pairs can improve prices because routing through ETH for a swap between two other assets (say, DAI/USDC) involves paying fees and slippage on two separate pairs instead of one.
